# The Lumen Project
## Created by Jonas Hartmann
### Version: Alpha
-------------------------------

This is an ongoing project that uses the [playn] framework, which enables cross-platform game development. The idea is to create an innovative and complex gameplay for a board game.

Even though the main aspects and gameplay are already implemented, it is still in alpha, because the gameplay may be altered after some more testing and feedback. Therefore, feel free to send your suggestions or even implement them directly, if you dare! ;)

Get a feeling of it by playing online: [lumen] 

The code archicture allows the development of multiple grid-based games, which only need to define their game rules/mechanics.
